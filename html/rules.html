      <p>This game will test your habilities to recognize world-wide famous couples!</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You should, based on the tips given in texts and images, reveal the names of the 
        couples' members at each level (it is worth to mention it could be about a real or a fictional pair,
        including the ones in cartoons). After finding out the answer, insert their names in their respective
        boxes: if correct, you will advance to the next stage, totalizing 8 levels. 
      </p>
      <p>Note: insert their first names only.</p>
      <h3>Prove your romance!</h3>
